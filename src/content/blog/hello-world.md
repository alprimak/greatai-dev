Welcome to greatai.dev.

I'm Alexander Primak, a software engineer building AI-powered products. This blog is where I'll document the journey - the wins, the failures, and everything in between.

## What I'm Building

Currently working on two main projects:

- **[Purely.app](https://getpurely.app)** - An ADHD-friendly task management PWA with offline-first architecture
- **[AskTurret](https://askturret.com)** - AI-powered data grid for financial applications

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public keeps me accountable and forces clarity in my thinking. If I can't explain a decision clearly here, I probably haven't thought it through well enough.

## What to Expect

- **Technical deep-dives** - How I solve specific problems
- **AI agents** - Building autonomous systems with Claude
- **SaaS journey** - Revenue, growth, and business decisions
- **Productivity** - Tools and workflows that actually work

Let's build something great.
