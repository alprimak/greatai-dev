Most content about data grids is either marketing fluff or academic theory. Same with AI in production — endless hype, very little practical guidance.

After years of building trading systems and financial applications, I've accumulated patterns that actually work. This site is where I'll share them.

## What You'll Find Here

**Data Grid Performance** — How to build grids that handle millions of rows with sub-millisecond updates. Virtualization strategies, state management patterns, and the trade-offs nobody talks about.

**AI in Production** — Practical approaches to shipping AI features. Not "here's a ChatGPT wrapper" but actual production concerns: reliability, hallucination prevention, latency optimization, and cost management.

**Finance Tech** — Software patterns for applications where correctness and speed both matter. Trading interfaces, analytics dashboards, real-time data pipelines.

## Why This Matters

The intersection of AI and high-performance data infrastructure is where the interesting problems are. Finance is just the domain — the patterns apply anywhere you need to move fast without breaking things.

If you're building data-intensive applications or integrating AI into serious software, this site is for you.
