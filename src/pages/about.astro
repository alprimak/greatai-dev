				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm {AUTHOR}, a software engineer specializing in high-performance data infrastructure and AI systems for finance.
				</p>

				<h2>What I Do</h2>
				<p>
					I build software where performance and correctness both matter. Currently focused on
					<a href="https://askturret.com">AskTurret</a> — AI-powered data grids for financial applications
					that handle millions of rows with real-time updates.
				</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					Years of experience building trading systems, analytics platforms, and data-intensive applications.
					I write about the technical patterns that actually work in production — not theory, but battle-tested approaches.
				</p>

				<h2>This Site</h2>
				<p>
					greatai.dev is where I share technical deep-dives on data grids, AI integration,
					and building software for finance. No fluff, just practical insights from shipping real products.
